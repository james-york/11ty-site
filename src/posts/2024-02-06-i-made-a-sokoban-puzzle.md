## ðŸ“¦ðŸ«·LLPokoban, the LLP sokoban

![alt_text](/assets/images/llpokoban.png "LLPokoban screenshot")


I've been obsessed with sokoban (å€‰åº«ç•ª) puzzles recently and thought I'd have a go at making one of my own. The game was made on the excellent [Puzzle Script](puzzlescript.net/) website, where you can program your own sokoban-style puzzle game, too. Give it a go, and let me know what you make!

The design of my game is based on the LLP logo:

You have to move the L L and P "boxes" into the correct positions. 

ðŸ‘‰ **You can play the game [here](https://cheapshot.itch.io/llpokoban)!** ðŸ‘ˆ

Do let me know your thoughts! (Leave a comment, or send me an email [here](mailto:york@meiji.ac.jp) ðŸ“§)
