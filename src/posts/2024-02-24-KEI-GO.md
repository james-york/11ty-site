I first had the idea to make this game back in 2017. Yes, a long time ago. 
At the time, I was inspired by the card game "Hanabi" and it's mechanic of having the cards faced away from the player. 

In this game, players have a "role" which is simply a number from 1 to 4. The number indicates seniority or social standing in general, so that the person who has the 4 role is the most senior and the person with 1 is least traveled up the social ladder. 

The game's core mechanic is using "keigo" (Japanese polite language) to speak to other players based on their role, thus giving them a clue as to how senior they are.
