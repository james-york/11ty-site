# KILXL Rule book

## ~Find the players’ real names!~

### [Story]
One day, bored with his/her daily life, Kira picked up a notebook that had fallen on the street.
On the cover of the notebook was written "Death Note" and inside were instructions on how to use it.

~The notebook is a powerful tool that can be used to kill someone. ~
Kira found this amusing and invented a real death game called “Werewolf Game.”
You are going to participate in this wargame, but will you be able to expel Kira without dying?


### [How to win?]

* Kira : Kills citizens until there is only one left or kills L.
* Citizen, L :  Expels Kira.
However, Kira cannot kill without a name match. Citizen and L cannot kill Kira unless Kira's face and name match.

### [Role]

**The grim reaper**: Moderator. All participants tell their real names, created names and their role to the grim reaper.

**Kira**: Killer. Board game turn→  played normally（As a citizen）. On the night turn, kill a citizen or L based on information obtained in the board game turn. You cannot kill if the name does not match.

**Second Kira**: Kira's backup. Before the game starts, the grim reaper will tell you all the real names of the players. (Name only. No matching with faces). However, you don’t  know who Kira is. Kira also does not know who the second Kira is. Therefore, you should use the morning guessing time and board game turns to give information to Kira without the citizens finding out.

**L**: Top detective. Let’s kill Kira together with the citizens. if L loses, the game is over. You can tell lies when you are asked a question at the question square. However, you must answer the truth at the red star square.

**Police**: Collect information on names in board game turns to find Kira. 

### [Items]

**Apples**: Favorite food of the grim reaper. This item can be used at any time except the night turn. Kira can ask for L's information, Citizen and L can ask for Kira's information by selecting from a list of questions. 

**The Grim Reaper's Eye**: Kira's special card. This item can be used on the night turn to learn the full name of the one person. The citizen side should aggressively aim for the item square, as handing this card to Kira will put them at a disadvantage.

### [How to play?]

Draw a role card and identify your role. On the name card, write the name you made, your number (which the reaper will wave to keep track of who is who), and your role. →Then hand it to the grim reaper.

~ Game Start! ~

**☆ Board Game Turn (Search Time)☆**

Roll the dice in order from the first one, and if you stop at a question square, select a person to ask a question (open to the public), if you stop at an item square, take an item card, if you stop at a skull square, roll the dice and answer with your name (Pip on dice ▶︎3, "Da" in the case of Yamada Tarou), and if someone goes around, the day is over. 

↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

**☆ Night turn ☆**

Citizens go to bed; Kira begins to act. Kira writes the name of the person he wants to kill on a piece of paper, and if it is correct, he kills him; if it is wrong, there will be nothing for that night.

↓ ↓

**☆ Morning turn ☆**
2 minutes
Everyone wakes up. The grim reaper reports if there are any deaths, and decides whether to banish someone or not , based on the information gathered from each of them. If the majority vote is for banishment, the person who wants to be banished is chosen and his/her real name is given.

If it is Kira, the game ends, if it is a citizen, the game continues, and if it is L, the game ends with suicide.

Repeat the ☆ turns until the match is over.
