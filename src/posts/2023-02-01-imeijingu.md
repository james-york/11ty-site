This simple party game can be played with any of the major AI art generators.

1. One player randomly picks a topic card (for example: ‘heart’)
2. Other players roll a dice to determine how many words they must use (3-6 words)
3. Those players use those words in the AI art generator without mentioning the topic word (e.g.: ‘love,’ ‘human,’ ‘body,’ for the topic 'heart')
4. Those players generate their art piece and share with the group.
5. The person that chose the topic chooses the best result and gives them the topic card. The topic card is counted as 1-point.

So it’s like a funky AI art generating version of Apples to Apples.
