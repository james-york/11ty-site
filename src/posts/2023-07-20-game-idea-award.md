## 💭 The competition

At the start of the semester, we spent a week examining the entries to the [Game Idea](https://www.nakayama-zaidan.or.jp/activity-sp_research-theme2023.html) award at the Nakayama Foundation. All students in my seminar class designed games and then we went through multiple discussion and feedback stages before we decided which ones we would submit. 

Finally, at the end of the class, we submitted our best game ideas. 

## 🏆 The prize

We won an "outstanding" award, which was awarded to only 10 of the 281 entries.
