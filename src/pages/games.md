As part of my work at Meiji University, I (and students) are developing games for educational purposes. This page features all of the games we've made (or worked on) as part of the ‚ú®**York Game Lab**‚ú®.

You can also find a selection of video games that I've made over on [itch.io](https://cheapshot.itch.io/).
